# LegoMindstorm-MotorControl-UNITN_ARL
This report is the presentation of the work done in the course Advanced Robotics Lab. The aim of the work was to design a controller for the motor of Lego MindStrom. The whole task consisted of the following activities: 1. Collection of the motor output data set (angular position) as a response to a step input (Percentage of maximum power to the motor) 2. Design of a filter for the above dataset 3. Motor parameter identification for creating a suitable mathematical model 4. Design of a feedback controller to control the power output of the motor 5. Simulation of the controller in Simulink 6. Implementation of the above controller in the Lego Mindstorm brick
